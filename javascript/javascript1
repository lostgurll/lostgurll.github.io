//This is about how we can declare variables and assign string values to them in JavaScript.
var name = "John Doe";
var nationality;
nationality = "American";
var thanks = "Thank you for your help!";
alert(thanks);




//This is about assigning numbers to variables in JavaScript.
var weight = 85; // weight in kg
var new weight = weight - 10 //weight after 2 months 



// AN expression made up of just variables and nothing else 
var num = 5;
var numtobeadded = 10;
var newnum = num + numtobeadded; // newnum is 15




//variable name should not start with a number but you can add number as long as it doesnt start wuth it 
// % is a special character in JavaScript and it is used to find the remainder of a division operation it is called modulus oprator 
var remainder = 10 % 3; // remainder is 1



// concatenation is the process of joining two strings together here is an example of concatenation
var username = "John";
alert("Hello, " + username + "!"); // This will show "Hello, John!" in an alert box
var message = "Welcome to the JavaScript tutorial.";
var banger = "!";
alert(message + banger); // This will show "Welcome to the JavaScript tutorial.!" in an alert box
// You can also use the += operator to concatenate strings
var greeting = "Hello, ";
greeting += "world!"; // greeting is now "Hello, world!"


//prompts
a prompt is a dialog box that asks the user for input.
var userName = prompt("Please enter your name:");
//in a prompt we can specify second parameter which is the default value that appears in the input field when the prompt is displayed
var question = "What is your species?";
var default answer = "human";
var spec = prompt(question, default_answer);
//if the user clicks cancel the prompt will return null
//if the user response is a number it comes as a string so we need to convert it to a number



//if statements
//if statements are used to execute a block of code if a condition is true
if x = prompt("where does the unicorn live ?");
if (x === "in your dreams") {
    alert("You are right!");
}
//=== is used whwn we are testing a variable for a value its a comparison operator that checks for both value and type
//!== is opposite of === it checks if the value is not equal to the other value 
if(yourticketnumber !== 12345) {
    alert("better luck next time!");
}


//if else and else if staments
//if else statements are used to execute a block of code if a condition is true and another

var x = prompt("What is my favorite color?");
if (x === "blue") {
    alert("You are correct!");
}
if (x !== "blue") {
    alert("You are wrong!");
}
var x = prompt("What is my favorite color?");
if (x === "blue") {
    alert("You are correct!");
} 
else {
    alert("You are wrong!");   
}
//else if statements are used to execute a block of code if a condition is true and another condition is false
//above written both codes are same but the second one is more concise 
//else if statement is used when all tests above have failed and we want to test another condition 


//sets of conditions
if (weight > 300 && time < 6 && age > 18) {
    alert("You are eligible for the ride!");
}
else {
    alert ("come back later!");
} 
//&& and statement is used to check if all staements are true all conditions must be true for the code block to execute
//|| or statement is used to check if at least one condition is true if any of the conditions is true the code block will execute

if (SAT > avg || GPA > 3.5 || extracurriculars == true) {
    alert("You are eligible for the scholarship!");
}
else {
    alert("You are not eligible for the scholarship!");
}
//if statements can be nested inside each other
if (age > 18) {
    if (weight > 300) {
        alert("You are eligible for the ride!");
    } else {
        alert("You are not eligible for the ride!");
    }
}
//this is not a good practice as it makes the code hard to read and understand
//instead we can use else if statements to make the code more readable      


//and and or statements can be used together to check multiple conditions , we use parentheses to group conditions together

//if statements nested 

if ( c === d ) {
    if ( x === y) {
    }
    else if {
        alert("x is not equal to y");
    }



//an array is a special type of variable that can hold multiple values in a single variable
var cities = ["New York", "Los Angeles", "Chicago", "Houston", "Phoenix"];
//we can access the values in an array using the index of the value java script automatically assigns an index to each value in the array starting from 0
alert(welcome to " + cities[0] + "!"); 
     //This will show "Welcome to New York!" in an alert box


//adding and removing values from an array
cities.push("San Diego"); // adds "San Diego" to the end of the array
cities.pop(); // removes the last value from the array
cities.unshift("San Francisco"); // adds "San Francisco" to the beginning of the array
cities.shift(); // removes the first value from the array   
//slice method is used to create a new array from a portion of the original array
var newCities = cities.slice(1, 3); // creates a new array with the values from index 1 to index 2 (not including index 3)
alert(newCities);  
// if we do not specify the second parameter it will take all the values from the first index to the end of the array
var newCities = cities.slice(1); // creates a new array with the values from index 1 to the end of the array
alert(newCities); // This will show the new array

// splice method is used to add or remove values from an array at a specific index
var names = [ "anjali", "sara", "john", "doe"];
names.splice(index , how many values to removeoptional, value to add, ...); // adds or removes values from the array at the specified index
names.splice(2, 1, "jane"); // removes the value at index 2 and adds "jane" at that index
alert(names); // This will show the updated array with "jane" at index 2 

//for loop is used to iterate over an array and perform an action on each value in the array
var eligiblecities = ["delhi", "mumbai", "bangalore", "chennai"];
for (var i = 0; i < eligiblecities.length; i++) {
